# ALSSC
**This is the code for our paper submitted to IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing**

**Title of the paper:** Active Learning-based Spectral-Spatial Classification for Discriminating Tree Species in Hyperspectral Images

**Authors:** Fei Tong and Yun Zhang


# Python Environment
**To set up the python environment, required libraries are:   
numpy  
scipy  
numba  
matplotlib    
gdal  
imageio  
scikit-learn  
joblib  
opencv-python**



# Dataset
**Before running the code, please download the dataset and put all downloaded files in the folder "data\\images"**  
For example, if you want to run ALSSC_PaviaU_Demo.py, please download and put both "PaviaU.mat" and "PaviaU_gt.mat" in the folder "data\\images\\PaviaU"
